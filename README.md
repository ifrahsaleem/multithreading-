# multithreading-
This is a multithreaded C++ program that simulates a queue of customers waiting in a store to pay their groceries. There are two (2) cashiers and a queue in the store, shared by these cashiers. One of the cashier always serves to the customers, while the other cashier serves when the current number of customers waiting in the queue passes a threshold value. When arrived, customers need to go to the rear of the queue and wait in that queue until their turn comes to be served by a cashier. Whenever a cashier is available, the customer at the front of the queue begins the checkout process with that cashier. In this simulation, the customer's arrivals and their transactions with the cashiers are done via a dynamic queue data structure and multithreading techniques. The time between arrivals of two customers is probabilistic. Moreover, the time for a cashier to finish a checkout process is also probabilistic. Thus, the inter-arrival time between two customers and the checkout durations of cashiers are random values. The parameters of these random values will be input.
